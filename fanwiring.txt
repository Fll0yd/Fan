the red wire from the motor is in the positive row on the bread board 
and the black wire from the motor is in row 4a on the bread board

also in row 4a is the collector of the transistor which puts the base in row 5a and he emitter in row 6a.
i have a resistor from row 5a on the bread board to row 7a and a jumper wire from row 7a of the bread board to pin 3 on the Arduino Uno

I then have two jumper wires going from row 6a on the bread board next to the transistors emitter, 
	both go to the other side of the bread board (ill call the rows on the opposite of the bread board (b)) 
one jumper wire goes to row 1b and the other jumper wire goes to row 5b

The short leg of the LED is in row 1b next to the black jumper wire from row 3a
the long leg of the LED is row 2b then I have a resistor going from row 2b to row 1a and a jumper wire from row 1a to pin 6 on the Arduino Uno

the button is in rows 5b (next to the black jumper wire from 3a) and 7b. I have a jumper wire from row 7b to pin 5 on the Arduino Uno

finally I have a red jumper wire going to the 5v pin on the Arduino from the positive rail on the bread board 
and a black jumper wire from row 6a (emitter) to the GND of the Arduino Uno.


1a = 4a
2a = 5a
3a = 6a

3b = 2b
2b = 1a
